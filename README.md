# RobitMCPlugin
This is basically the import of [Robit's AI core](https://github.com/TheRoboDoc/Robit) into Minecraft as a Paper plugin

## Install
1. Have a PaperMC server. You can download that [here](https://papermc.io/)
2. Download [RobitMC.jar](https://github.com/TheRoboDoc/RobitMCPlugin/releases/download/v0.0.3/RobitMC.jar)
3. Run the server at least once
4. Put [RobitMC.jar](https://github.com/TheRoboDoc/RobitMCPlugin/releases/download/v0.0.3/RobitMC.jar) into the plugins folder `'/Your_cool_server/plugins/'`
5. Create a file in that folder called `token.txt`
6. Put your OpenAI API key into that file. How to get that you can find [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key)

## How to interact
Interacting with Robit is simple. Just say *"Robit"* in chat. Any other combination works too. It isn't case-sensitive. So *"rObIt"* would also work. As long as the letters are correct
